    <!-- This script will eventually point to the bundled React app -->
    <!-- For development, a local dev server would handle this. -->
    <!-- For a production build, it would be something like <script defer src="static/js/main.chunk.js"></script> -->
    <!-- For now, we'll assume a build step will create a bundle referenced here, e.g., bundle.js or main.js -->
    <script src="src/index.js" type="module"></script>
    <!-- Note: Using type="module" for direct browser ES6 module loading during dev,
         a bundler like Webpack/Parcel would be typical for production.
         For a Chrome extension, we'll need to ensure the build output is correctly referenced.
         For now, this direct link helps in structuring.
         The final version will likely need a bundled main.js from src/index.js -->
