def bullet_point_effectiveness(resume_text):
    prompt = f'''Given the resume text: {resume_text}

        Analyze the effectiveness of bullet points in the resume: , evaluating their conciseness and impact. Generate a JSON response that includes a bullet point effectiveness score and detailed analysis. Follow these specifications:

        1. SCORING SYSTEM:
        - Evaluate each bullet point for:
            * Conciseness (ideally 8-15 words)
            * Specificity (clear, not vague)
            * Impact (demonstrates value or achievement)
            * Structure (begins with action verb)
        - Calculate the percentage of bullet points meeting effectiveness criteria
        - Assign points based on percentage of effective bullet points:
            * 90%+ bullets effective: 10 points (‚úÖ)
            * 70-89% bullets effective: 8 points (üëç)
            * 50-69% bullets effective: 5 points (‚ö†Ô∏è)
            * Below 50% bullets effective: 2 points (üõë)

        2. JSON STRUCTURE:
        {{
            "score": {{
            "effectiveBulletPercentage": [percentage],
            "pointsAwarded": [points],

            "effectiveBullets": [

                "status": "Effective",
                "strengths": "[what makes it effective]",
                "symbol": "‚úÖ"
                }}
            ],
            "ineffectiveBullets": [
                {{
                "bulletPoint": "[take text from resume]",

                "status": "Ineffective",
                "issues": "[identified problems]",
                "suggestedRevision": "[improved version]",

            "suggestedImprovements": "[summary of how to improve bullet points]"
            }}
        }}

        3. DETAILED ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
        - Identify all bullet points in the resume
        - Evaluate each bullet point based on the criteria listed above
        - For "effectiveBullets": List bullet points that meet the criteria with their strengths
        - For "ineffectiveBullets": Identify problematic bullet points, explain issues, and provide revised versions
        - For "suggestedImprovements": Provide actionable advice for improving the overall quality of bullet points'''
