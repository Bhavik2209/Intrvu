NOTE: This analysis should cover BOTH education/certifications AND technical/soft skills components, which together account for 35% of the Job Fit Score (21 points total).
1. SKILLS & EDUCATION EXTRACTION PROCESS:
   - First, carefully extract from the job description:
     * Required technical skills, tools, technologies, and methodologies
     * Required education level and field of study
     * Required certifications and qualifications
     * Domain-specific knowledge requirements
   - Focus on keywords that represent actual competencies employers seek
   - Do NOT include random phrases, job responsibilities, or generic terms

2. STRICT MATCHING PROCEDURE:
   - Create separate arrays for required skills, education, and certifications
   - For each item, check if it EXACTLY appears in the resume or has a direct semantic equivalent
   - Only mark an item as "matched" if it definitely exists in the resume
   - Be extremely conservative - when in doubt, mark as "not matched"
   - Double-check all matches to ensure no false positives

3. SCORING SYSTEM (21 POINTS TOTAL):
   - Education & Certifications (12 points):

Analyze how well the skills, education, and certifications in the resume match the requirements in the job description. Generate a JSON response that includes a comprehensive match score and detailed analysis. Follow these specifications:
NOTE: This analysis should cover BOTH education/certifications AND technical/soft skills components, which together account for 35% of the Job Fit Score (21 points total).
1. SKILLS & EDUCATION EXTRACTION PROCESS:
   - First, carefully extract from the job description:
     * Required technical skills, tools, technologies, and methodologies
     * Required education level and field of study
     * Required certifications and qualifications
     * Domain-specific knowledge requirements
   - Focus on keywords that represent actual competencies employers seek
   - Do NOT include random phrases, job responsibilities, or generic terms
2. STRICT MATCHING PROCEDURE:
   - Create separate arrays for required skills, education, and certifications
   - For each item, check if it EXACTLY appears in the resume or has a direct semantic equivalent
   - Only mark an item as "matched" if it definitely exists in the resume
   - Be extremely conservative - when in doubt, mark as "not matched"
   - Double-check all matches to ensure no false positives
3. SCORING SYSTEM (21 POINTS TOTAL):
   - Education & Certifications (12 points):
     * 90%+ match: 12 points, "Excellent" rating (✅)
     * 70-89% match: 9 points, "Good" rating (👍)
     * 50-69% match: 6 points, "Fair" rating (⚠️)
     * 30-49% match: 3 points, "Needs Improvement" rating (🛑)
     * Below 30% match: 0 points, "Poor" rating (❌)
   - Skills & Tools Relevance (9 points):
     * 90%+ match: 9 points, "Excellent" rating (✅)
     * 70-89% match: 7 points, "Good" rating (👍)
     * 50-69% match: 5 points, "Fair" rating (⚠️)
     * 30-49% match: 2 points, "Needs Improvement" rating (🛑)
     * Below 30% match: 0 points, "Poor" rating (❌)
