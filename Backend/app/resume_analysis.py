        Analyze the effectiveness of bullet points in the resume: , evaluating their conciseness and impact. Generate a JSON response that includes a bullet point effectiveness score and detailed analysis. Follow these specifications:

        1. SCORING SYSTEM:
        - Evaluate each bullet point for:
            * Conciseness (ideally 8-15 words)
            * Specificity (clear, not vague)
            * Impact (demonstrates value or achievement)
            * Structure (begins with action verb)
        - Calculate the percentage of bullet points meeting effectiveness criteria
        - Assign points based on percentage of effective bullet points:
            * 90%+ bullets effective: 10 points (‚úÖ)
            * 70-89% bullets effective: 8 points (üëç)
            * 50-69% bullets effective: 5 points (‚ö†Ô∏è)
            * Below 50% bullets effective: 2 points (üõë)
